        <p>
          I'm the head master, music producer and the developer for Siide Music!
          On my spare time when Iâ€™m not taking the car, I often take long trips
          with my motorcycle. I have a deep passion for music. I like to produce
          and publish my music during my spare time. I distribute my music
          through Spotify, iTunes, Tidal and Google Play. I also have a passion
          for mixing at DJ-tables. Besides that, I work out as often as I can at
          the gym or spend time with my friends and family.
